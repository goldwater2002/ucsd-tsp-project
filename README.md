# UCSD TSP Project

This project simulates a delivery person trying to find the shortest route to visit 10 buildings on the UCSD campus and return to the start.

## How it works

- We use real coordinates of 10 UCSD landmarks
- A Genetic Algorithm is used to find a near-optimal solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem
- The result is visualized using matplotlib

## Files

- `ucsd_locations.csv`: Coordinates of buildings
- `tsp_ga.py`: The Genetic Algorithm implementation
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook to run and visualize the result
